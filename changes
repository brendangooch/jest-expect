v1.1.0
    added toBeSameArray() method to compare arrays containing primitive datatypes

v2.0.0
    changed the way the package functions
    client now instantiates the JestExpect class
    this adds the ability to negate any test by calling .not ie EXPECT.not.toBe(foo, bar)
    this is better than writing a negative version of each method
